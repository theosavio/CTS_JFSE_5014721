Step 1: Understand Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort

How it works: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) (if the list is already sorted)
Average and Worst Case: O(n^2) (due to repeated comparisons and swaps)

Insertion Sort

How it works: Builds the sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position in the already sorted part.

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) (if the list is already sorted)
Average and Worst Case: O(n^2) (if the list is in reverse order)


Quick Sort

How it works: Divides the array into two smaller arrays based on a pivot element, such that elements less than the pivot are on one side and greater elements are on the other. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.

Time Complexity:

Best Case and Average Case: O(n log n) (good partitioning)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (if the pivot selection is poor, e.g., always the smallest or largest element)

Merge Sort

How it works: Divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

Time Complexity:
Best, Average, and Worst Case: O(n log n) (because it always splits the array and merges them)

Time Complexity Comparison

Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n) (if the array is already sorted)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)

Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n) (good pivot selection)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (poor pivot selection)

Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred Over Bubble Sort

Efficiency: Quick Sort is significantly more efficient on large datasets due to its O(n log n) average time complexity, whereas Bubble Sort is inefficient due to its O(n^2) complexity.

Performance: Quick Sort is usually faster in practice even compared to other O(n log n) algorithms like Merge Sort because of its in-place sorting mechanism, which reduces the overhead of additional memory usage.
