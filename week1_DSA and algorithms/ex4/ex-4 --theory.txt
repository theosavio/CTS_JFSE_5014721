Step 1: Understand Array Representation


How Arrays are Represented in Memory:

Memory Allocation: Arrays are a contiguous block of memory where elements are stored sequentially. Each element in the array is stored at a memory address that is offset by a constant value (depending on the data type).

Advantages of Arrays:

Fast Access: You can access elements directly using the index in constant time, O(1), because the memory address of any element can be calculated directly.

Fixed Size: Once an array is created, it has a fixed size, which can be both an advantage (predictable memory usage) and a limitation (inflexibility).


Analysis

Time Complexity of Operations:

Add Operation:

Time Complexity: O(1) if there is space in the array.
If the array is full, the time complexity of adding could be O(n) if you need to resize the array (though resizing isn't implemented in this example).

Search Operation:

Time Complexity: O(n) because you may need to check each element in the array.
Traverse Operation:

Time Complexity: O(n) because you are visiting each element once.

Delete Operation:

Time Complexity: O(n) because after finding the element, you may need to shift the subsequent elements to fill the gap left by the deleted element.

Limitations of Arrays and When to Use Them:

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, which can be limiting if the number of employees is not known in advance or fluctuates.

Insertion/Deletion Cost: Insertion and deletion operations, except at the end, require shifting elements, making them costly in terms of time complexity (O(n)).

Better Alternatives: For dynamic or frequently changing data, other data structures like ArrayList, LinkedList, or HashMap can be more suitable due to their dynamic resizing and more efficient operations.
