Step 1: Understand Recursive Algorithms
Recursion:

Concept: Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem until it reaches a base case. This approach is particularly useful for problems that can be naturally divided into similar subproblems.

Advantages: Simplifies code for problems like tree traversals, dynamic programming, and mathematical computations (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, factorial).

Disadvantages: Can lead to excessive computation or stack overflow if not optimized (e.g., through memoization or iterative solutions).

Step 2: Setup

We'll create a method to calculate the future value of an investment or financial metric using a recursive approach based on past growth rates.

Step 3: Implementation

Recursive Algorithm to Predict Future Values
We will assume the following:

currentValue is the current value of the investment.
growthRate is the percentage growth rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5% growth).
years is the number of years into the future for which we want to predict the value.

Step 4: Analysis

Time Complexity of the Recursive Algorithm

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of years for which we are predicting the value. This is because the function makes one recursive call for each year until it reaches the base case.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursive call stack, where n is the depth of recursion (i.e., the number of years).

Optimization to Avoid Excessive Computation

Memoization: If the recursive function were performing redundant calculations, memoization (caching previously computed results) could be used to optimize it. However, in this case, each calculation is unique per year, so memoization isn't necessary.

Iterative Approach: Converting the recursive solution into an iterative one could reduce the space complexity to O(1) by avoiding the recursion stack overhead. This would be more efficient for large values of n.
