Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories

Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial for handling large inventories because they ensure:

Fast Access
Efficient Storage
Scalability
Maintainability
For an inventory management system, suitable data structures include:

ArrayList: Good for ordered collections and efficient iteration, but not ideal for frequent insertions and deletions.

HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, making it suitable for inventory management where quick access by product ID is necessary.

TreeMap: Maintains sorted order of keys, useful if sorted product listings are needed, but has O(log n) time complexity for basic operations.
